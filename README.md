# ObjectIdentification_ComputerVision

Baxter is an industrial robot built by Rethink Robotics. It has two 7 DOF arms, cameras and force sensing actuators attached to it. In this work, we look to explore the utility of Baxter to automate the sorting of fruits into two baskets from a heap. We have used the physics based simulation engine Gazebo for our work. The end-to-end project required the harmony of diverse fields of robotics like dynamic modeling, computer vision, motion planning and robot control. ROS wrappers have been written for all the individual nodes. We have been able to successfully implement the individual nodes and to build a Behavioral master to enable communication between the different nodes. 

This repo consists of the code specific to the Computer Vision track of the project. For the code of the entire project, refer to https://github.com/wpi-dynamics-spring-2019-baxter/BaxterObjectSorting 

The overall system architecture is as follows:
